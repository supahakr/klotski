# Latest Updates Summary

## ✅ All Requested Changes Implemented

### 1. Board State Popup - Fixed Position ✅
**Location**: Now in **upper right corner**
- Changed to `position: fixed; top: 80px; right: 15px`
- Added `z-index: 100` to ensure it stays on top
- No longer blocks the view

### 2. Customizable Board Size ✅
**New Feature**: Adjustable board dimensions in the editor
- Width: 3-8 cells
- Height: 3-10 cells
- Input fields in editor with "Apply Size" button
- Grid dynamically resizes
- Pieces outside bounds are automatically removed when resizing
- Default: 4×5 (standard Klotski)

### 3. Draggable Pieces ✅
**Full drag-and-drop implementation**:
- Click and drag pieces to reposition them
- Smooth real-time movement
- Collision detection prevents overlap
- Snap to grid alignment
- Visual feedback (opacity 0.7, shadow while dragging)
- Cursor changes: `grab` → `grabbing`
- Touch support included
- **Double-click to remove** pieces

### 4. Default Parameters Updated ✅

| Parameter | Old Default | New Default | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Repulsion Exponent** | 2.0 | **0.5** | Slower falloff = more spread out |
| **Edge Constraint** | 0.3 | **1.0 (max)** | Strict 3-unit edges within clusters |
| **Planarity Bias** | 0.5 | **0.0** | Off by default (user can enable) |

### 5. Dampening Explanation ✅
Added tooltip: "Movement friction (higher = slower, more stable)"

**What dampening does**:
- Controls velocity decay each iteration
- 0.85 = keep 85% of velocity, lose 15% to "friction"
- Lower (0.5-0.7): Faster, can oscillate
- Higher (0.85-0.95): Slower, more stable
- Like air resistance in physics simulation

### 6. State Limit Increased ✅
**Max states**: 10,000 → **100,000**

**Why this matters**:
- Standard Klotski has ~25,000-30,000 reachable states
- Old limit of 10,000 was cutting off the graph!
- New limit allows complete exploration
- Custom boards with more pieces supported

**State count verification**:
- With canonical hashing (identical pieces indistinguishable)
- Expect ~25,000-30,000 for standard configuration
- See `STATE_COUNT_VERIFICATION.md` for details

## New Features Summary

### Customizable Board
```
Width:  3-8 cells   (default: 4)
Height: 3-10 cells  (default: 5)
```

### Drag & Drop
```
Click + Drag → Move piece
Double-click → Remove piece
Collision detection → Prevents overlap
Real-time visual feedback
```

### Improved Defaults
```
n = 0.5     (more spread out graphs)
Edge = 1.0  (strict 3-unit edges)
Planarity = 0.0 (natural curvature)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Board Size
- Dynamic CSS grid: `grid-template-columns: repeat(${boardWidth}, 60px)`
- Validation: Prevents invalid sizes (too small/large)
- State preservation: Resizing keeps pieces that still fit

### Drag System
```javascript
startDrag()  → Track mouse position, set offset
onDrag()     → Calculate grid position, check collision
stopDrag()   → Release, clean up listeners
```

### Collision Detection
```javascript
canPlacePieceAt(x, y, width, height, excludeId)
→ Checks bounds + overlaps with other pieces
→ Excludes self when dragging
```

### State Limit
```javascript
generate(initialState, maxStates = 100000)
→ BFS continues until queue empty OR limit reached
→ Console logs "Max states limit: 100000"
→ Reports final count
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple 2-Piece Board
1. Open editor
2. Click "Clear All"
3. Add 2× small 1×1 pieces
4. Generate graph
5. Expected: ~6-12 states

### Standard Klotski
1. Click "Load Default" or leave default
2. Generate graph  
3. Expected: ~25,000-30,000 states
4. Console will show exact count

### Custom Large Board
1. Set board to 6×8
2. Add many pieces
3. Generate graph
4. Can handle 50,000+ states

## Parameter Recommendations

### For Clean Grids (2-3 simple pieces):
```
Repulsion Exponent: 0.5-1.0
Edge Constraint: 0.8-1.0
Planarity Bias: 0.0 (natural) or 1.0-1.5 (very flat)
Iterations: 400-500
```

### For Standard Klotski:
```
Repulsion Exponent: 0.5 (default)
Edge Constraint: 1.0 (default)
Planarity Bias: 0.0 (default)
Iterations: 300 (default)
Sample Size: 120-150
```

### For Complex Custom Boards:
```
Repulsion Exponent: 1.0-1.5 (tighter)
Edge Constraint: 0.6-0.8 (some flexibility)
Planarity Bias: 0.5 (moderate flattening)
Iterations: 500+
Sample Size: 150-200
```

## Files Changed

- ✅ `index.html` - Board size controls, drag & drop, updated defaults
- ✅ `visualization.js` - (no changes needed)
- ✅ Documentation files created
