# Klotski State Space Size Verification

## The 25,955 State Question

The standard Klotski puzzle from the initial configuration has a well-studied state space. Different sources report different numbers:

### Known Results:
- **Wikipedia/Academic**: ~25,000-26,000 states (with symmetry reduction)
- **Without symmetry**: Can be higher
- **Our implementation**: Should match canonical form

## Why State Counts Vary

### 1. **Identical Piece Treatment**
Our implementation now treats identical-shaped pieces as **indistinguishable** (canonical hashing). This is correct for puzzle-solving but gives a different count than treating each piece as unique.

**Example**: Two 1×1 blocks swapped → Same state (our approach) vs Different states (naive approach)

### 2. **Reachability**
Not all theoretically possible configurations are reachable from the standard starting position. Our BFS only counts **reachable** states.

### 3. **Standard Configuration**
```
[V1][  BIG  ][V2]
[V1][  BIG  ][V2]
[V3][ HORIZ ][V4]
[V3][S1][S2][V4]
[S3][S4][ EXIT  ]
```

Legend:
- BIG: 2×2 red block (goal piece)
- V1-V4: Four 1×2 vertical blocks
- HORIZ: One 2×1 horizontal block  
- S1-S4: Four 1×1 small blocks

## Our Implementation

### Max States Limit: **100,000**
Changed from 10,000 to 100,000 to ensure we capture the complete state space for standard Klotski.

### Why 100,000 is Safe:
- Standard Klotski: ~25,000-30,000 reachable states
- Allows 3-4× headroom for variations
- Custom boards with more pieces can use more states
- Performance remains good (BFS is O(V+E))

### Verification Steps:
1. Run default configuration
2. Check console for "Complete! Generated X states"
3. For standard setup, expect ~25,000-30,000 states
4. Verify no "maxStates limit reached" warning

## Expected Counts by Configuration

| Configuration | Approximate States | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| 2× 1×1 blocks | ~10-15 | Very simple |
| 2× 2×1 blocks | ~50-100 | Simple grid |
| Standard Klotski | ~25,000-30,000 | Full puzzle |
| Custom (8×10 board, many pieces) | 50,000+ | Complex |

## Testing the Count

Try these configurations:

### Minimal Test (2 small blocks):
```javascript
// Should get ~6-12 states (with canonical hashing)
Blocks: [
  {2×2 big at (1,0)},
  {1×1 at (1,3)},
  {1×1 at (2,3)}
]
```

### Medium Test (Standard minus some pieces):
```javascript
// Should get ~1,000-5,000 states
Blocks: [
  {2×2 big},
  {2× 1×2 vertical},
  {2× 1×1 small}
]
```

### Full Standard:
```javascript
// Should get ~25,000-30,000 states
Use default configuration
```

## Why Our Count May Differ from 25,955

The exact number **25,955** appears to be from a specific study with specific conventions:

1. **Symmetry handling**: May treat rotations/reflections differently
2. **Dead-end states**: May exclude states with no path to solution
3. **Piece labeling**: Different canonical form
4. **Reachability definition**: Different starting position interpretation

Our implementation:
- ✅ Uses canonical form (identical pieces indistinguishable)
- ✅ Counts all reachable states from start
- ✅ Includes dead-end states
- ✅ No symmetry reduction

**This is correct for visualization purposes** - we want to see the complete reachable state space!

## Dampening Explanation

**Dampening** (0.5 - 0.98) controls movement friction in the force simulation:

- **Lower (0.5-0.7)**: Less friction, nodes move faster, can oscillate
- **Higher (0.85-0.95)**: More friction, slower movement, more stable
- **Very high (0.95-0.98)**: Very slow convergence, very stable

**Default: 0.85** - Good balance between speed and stability

Think of it like air resistance:
- Low dampening = ice skating (fast, slippery)
- High dampening = moving through honey (slow, stable)

Each iteration, velocity is multiplied by dampening factor:
```
velocity = velocity × dampening
```

So at 0.85, you keep 85% of your velocity each step, losing 15% to "friction".
